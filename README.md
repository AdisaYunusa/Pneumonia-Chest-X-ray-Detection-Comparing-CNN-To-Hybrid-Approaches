# Pneumonia Chest X-ray Detection Comparing CNN To Hybrid Approaches

The aim of this research is to develop a highly efficient and accurate model capable of detecting pneumonia in CXR scan images while addressing its associated difficulties.

The research goal was accomplished by conducting a performance assessment of CNN, hybrid, and pre trained models and comparing their results.

The approaches implemented encompass the following:
1. CNN (Base line model)
2. CNN Hyperparameters tuned model
3. CNN Random Forest (CNN-RF) Hybrid Model
4. CNN K-Nearest Neighbours (CNN-KNN) Hybrid Model
5. CNN Decision Trees (CNN-DT) Hybrid Model
6. ResNet50 (Pre-trained model).

The following are the steps used to achieved the aim:
1. Imported libraries, exploratory data analysis, and dataset importation
2. Input preprocessing
3. Model development
4. Training, validation, testing and evaluation.


With an excellent model loss trend in addit ion to precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity , specificity and ROC AUC of 85%, 84%, 83%, 84%, 95%, 72% and 94% respectively , CNN has proved to be capable of outperforming hybrid and pre-trained models in detecting pneumonia in CXR scan images The CNN RF hybrid model performed the least. While the aim of this res earch was achi eved to develop a robust and efficient model capable of detecting pneumonia in CXR, there is still room for future research which includes but is not limited to:
1. Future research can explore advanced transfer learning techniques tailored to pneumonia detection.
2. Developing CNN models that provide not only accurate predictions but also clear explanations for their decisions.
